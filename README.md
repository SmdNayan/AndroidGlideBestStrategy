## Implementation
Now I show How to implement Glide with the best cache strategy. 

First add the below dependecy library on your `build.gradle(Module: app)` gradle
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.11.0'
  annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.11.0'
}
```
Then sync gradle file. After that go to your Image activity and call Glide with your image link. like this
```
Glide.with(this)
    .load("http://goo.gl/gEgYUd")
    .into(imageView);
```
